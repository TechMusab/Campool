## ðŸ”„ Required: Database Migration

**IMPORTANT:** Existing users in the database don't have `whatsappNumber`. You have two options:

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended for Testing)
```javascript
// Delete all existing users
db.users.deleteMany({})
```
All users will need to sign up again with WhatsApp number.

### Option 2: Add Default WhatsApp to Existing Users
```javascript
// Add default WhatsApp to existing users
db.users.updateMany(
  { whatsappNumber: { $exists: false } },
  { $set: { whatsappNumber: '0000000000' } }
)
```
Existing users can log in but should update their WhatsApp number.
